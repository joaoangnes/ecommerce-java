## E-Commerce Java

Project carried out for a college subject, where I had to follow the following steps:

1.	Considering an e-commerce system, you are responsible for developing the part relating to the payment system. The module to be developed must be flexible and allow easy switching between different payment providers.<br>
  -	Draw the ECommerce class and the other classes involved in the project.
  - Implement the classes, without the need to persist data in databases. If you believe that some persistence functionality is necessary, use the terminal / console to demonstrate and always work with the data in memory.
  -	Indicate the design patterns adopted, justifying their adoption and their importance to the project.


2.	Considering an e-commerce system, implement the "Shopping Cart" class so that it is possible to add different items (they can be products or services) and whose control is focused on the item, the quantity and the price of the item.<br>
  - Draw the Shopping Cart class, associating it with the ECommerce class (from the previous question) and the other classes involved in the project.
  - Implement the classes, without the need to persist data in databases. If you believe that some persistence functionality is necessary, use the terminal / console to demonstrate and always work with the data in memory.
  - Indicate the design patterns adopted, justifying their adoption and their importance.

3.	Still considering the e-commerce system, implement a class capable of informing the logistics agents about the confirmation of the purchase. When the purchase is confirmed, the logistics agent should be informed and receive the details of the delivery to be made. If the purchase is canceled before delivery, the logistics agent must be informed of the cancellation and return the shipped products or cancel the transport order.<br>
  - Draw the AgentLogistic class, associating it with the ECommerce class (from the previous question) and the other classes involved in the project.
  - Implement the classes, without the need to persist data in databases. If you believe that some persistence functionality is necessary, use the terminal / console to demonstrate and always work with the data in memory.
  - Indicate the design patterns adopted, justifying their adoption and their importance to the project
